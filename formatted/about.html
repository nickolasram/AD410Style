                <p>This is the initial prototype of Cultural CS Bytes.</p>
                <p>Cultural CS Bytes is an online flashcard website consisting of multiple-choice questions typical for a pre/post-test for an introductory high school computer science course or the first semester of an AP Computer Science Principles class.</p>
                <p>The main difference between Cultural CS Bytes (CCSB) and other flashcard systems is that students can learn CS through stories that represent their life experiences in a "culture" that engages them.   Students can also take flashcard learning sessions that mix in questions from a variety of “cultures” but still have each the same underlying computer science principles.</p>
                <p>Data stored through this prototype will not persist beyond the next update. This prototype makes no assertions about privacy.  Users should feel free to use fake data in registering.</p>
                <p>Cultural CS Bytes is free to teachers to supplement their courses and individual students who want to learn CS independently.
